# StarEvolution
A simulation of a sky with stars that are randomly generated and then move randomly. 
Including simple rules: 
- If a star can't move, it disappears 
- If a star moves to place x and another star moves to place x, they merge

So the more we advance in the time steps, the fewer stars there will be.
In the end there will be only one star no matter what
